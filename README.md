# ADAS1

Goal of this project is to program an app in Android Studio that sends traffic sign images via MQTT to the Python server where the server identifies the traffic sign and classificates them. Then the server sends the image back to the user and the user sees the result. For demonstrating purposes the images were pre stored to the device. <br>
